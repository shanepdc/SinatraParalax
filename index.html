             <p>Frank Sinatra began singing professionally as a teenager. He learned music by ear and never learned how to read music himself.
             <br><br>
             In 1935 he got his first break. His mother persuaded a local singing found, The 3 Flashes to let him join the group. Sinatra soon learned that they would be auditioning for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour show and ‘begged’ the group to let him sing with them on their act. Together with Sinatra they became know as the Hoboken Four.</p>
             <p>Sinatra topped the male singer polls in Billboard and Down Beat magazines by 1941. His appeal to bobby soxers (teenage girls at the time were know as this) revealed a whole new audience for the popular music which had been recorded mainly for adults at the time. The sudden craze for Sinatra became known as the “Sinatramania” after his legendary opening at the Paramoind Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942.</p>
             <p>Frank Sinatras carear had declined in the 1950’s. From this he turned his focus to performing in Las Vegas with the <a  href="#slide4" title="Next Section">The Rat Pack</a>.
             After a short retirement in the early 70’s Sintra returned with the album ‘Ol Blue Eyes Is Back”. He continued to tour and perform around the worl up until the late 80's.</p>
